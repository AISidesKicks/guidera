## 💡 The Secret Sauce: SBE + EDD + BDD + TDD

| Methodology | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 🔍 **SBE** (Specification By Example) | Real examples capture true intent | You build what users actually want |
| 🎯 **EDD** (Example-Driven Development) | Specific scenarios guide design decisions | Edge cases surface early |
| 📋 **BDD** (Behavior-Driven Development) | Given-When-Then scenarios as specs | Everyone speaks the same language |
| ✅ **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) | Red-Green-Refactor cycle | Code that works, guaranteed |
